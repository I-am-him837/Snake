This is a recreation of the google snake game. When the program runs then the game should imediatly start with the snake moving to the left. Initialy the snake will bee 4 units in length including the headm and an additional unit of length will be added to the tail for every apple eaten. Along with the snake the board will include three apple objects whiich will be generated iin a random position. the snake will start in the center of the board.
Upon a arrow key being clicked, the snake will move in the direction in question continuesly without stop. If a snake hits one of the three apple objects then the apple in question will be terminated and he snake will gain 1 unit of length. When a apple has been eaten then a new apple will regenerate in a random position. Apples will stay stationary indefinetly. 
If the snake head collides with either the eedge of the board or its own body then a title will appear in the middle of the board stating game over. The head of the snake is essntially what the player is controling. All body parts following will inheriet the prrevious coordinates of the snake head.
